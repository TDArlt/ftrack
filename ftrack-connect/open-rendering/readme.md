This one opens an associated rendering using djv_view.

It will use the `associatedFile`-attribute of an entity. If this parameter does not exist or is empty, the action will not be shown.

Please note that this script is created for the workflow at unexpected GmbH. If you have a different file structure, you may need to change the "crawling" to the renderings.
