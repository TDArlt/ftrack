This is a boiler plate code for an action.
It's intended for having a working codebasis (with the "new" API) as a start, including:

- Show a label and icon for this action
- Identify entities
- Run an async job
- Create a file and return it with the job
- Have just one file (other repos use links between different files, which is great but you tend to loose the overview which component does what)

Comments and sections help you to find your way.
